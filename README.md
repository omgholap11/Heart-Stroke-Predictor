# Heart Stroke Predictor

## Overview
The Heart Stroke Predictor is a machine learning project designed to predict the likelihood of heart stroke occurrence based on various health and demographic factors. This tool aims to assist in early detection and prevention of strokes by analyzing patient data and providing risk assessments.

## About the Project
Heart stroke is one of the leading causes of death and disability worldwide. Early prediction and timely intervention can significantly reduce the risk and severity of strokes. This project leverages data science and machine learning techniques to build a predictive model that can identify individuals at high risk of experiencing a stroke.

## Key Features
- Predictive analysis based on health indicators
- Data-driven insights for stroke risk assessment
- Machine learning model for accurate predictions
- User-friendly interface for inputting patient data

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Machine Learning Libraries (scikit-learn, pandas, numpy)
- Data Visualization Tools
- Jupyter Notebook

## Dataset
The model is trained on a comprehensive dataset containing various patient attributes such as age, gender, medical history, lifestyle factors, and other relevant health metrics that contribute to stroke risk.

## Goals
- Develop an accurate and reliable stroke prediction model
- Provide early warning signals for high-risk individuals
- Support healthcare professionals in making informed decisions
- Raise awareness about stroke risk factors

## Getting Started
This project is currently in development. More details about installation and usage will be added as the project progresses.
